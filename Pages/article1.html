                <p>Today it has become necessary to demolish the myth of the  <span class="fun"> "star" artist </span> who only produces masterpieces for a small group of ultra-intelligent people. It must be understood that as long as art stands aside from the problems of life it will only interest a very few people. Culture today is becoming a mass affair, and the artist must step down from his pedestal and be prepared to make a sign for a butcher's shop (if he knows how to do it). The artist must cast off the last rags of romanticism and become active as a man among men, well up in present-day techniques, materials and working methods. Without losing his innate aesthetic sense he must be able to respond with humility and competence to the demands his neighbours may make of him.</p>

                <p>  Anyone working in the field of design has a hard task ahead of him: <span class="highlight"> to clear his neighbour's mind of all preconceived notions of art and artists, notions picked up at schools where they condition you to think one way for the whole of your life, without stopping to think that life changes</span> - and today more rapidly than ever. It is therefore up to us designers to make known our working methods in clear and simple terms, the methods we think are the truest, the most up-to-date, the most likely to resolve our common aesthetic problems. Anyone who uses a properly designed object feels the presence of an artist who has worked for him, bettering his living conditions and encouraging him to develop his taste and sense of beauty. </p>

                    <p>When we give a place of honour in the drawing-room to an ancient <span class="fun"> Etruscan vase </span> which we consider beautiful, well proportioned and made with precision and economy, we must also remember that the vase once had an extremely common use. Most probably it was used for cooking-oil. It was made by a designer of those times, when art and life went hand in hand and there was no such thing as a work of art to look at and just any old thing to use.</p>
                    <p>I hope that other designers will make similar efforts to spread knowledge of our work, for our methods are daily asserting themselves as the fittest way of gaining the confidence of men at large, and of giving a meaning to our present way of life. Design came into being in 1919, when  <span class="fun"> Walter Gropius </span> founded the Bauhaus at Weimar. Part of the prospectus of this school reads:</p>

                <p> From that time on we have watched an ever more rapid succession of new styles in the world of art: <span class="fun"> abstract art, Dada, Cubism, Surrealism, Neo-Abstract art, Neo-Dada, pop and op. </span> Each one gobbles up its predecessor and we start right back at the beginning again.</p>

                <p> He is a planner with an aesthetic sense. Certain industrial products depend in large measure on him for their success.
                    Nearly always the shape of a thing, be it a typewriter, a pair of binoculars, an armchair, a ventilator, a saucepan or a refrigerator, will have an impoitant effect on sales: the better designed it is, the more it will sell.</p>
                <p> <span class="highlight">The term 'designer' was first used in this sense in America. </span> It does not refer to an industrial designer, who designs machines or mechanical parts, workshops or other specialized buildings, He is in fact a design engineer, and if he has a motor-scooter on the drawing-board he does not give a great deal of importance to the aesthetic side of things, or at the most he applies a personal idea of what a motor-scooter ought to look like.</p>
                 <p> I once asked an engineer who had designed a motor-scooter why he had chosen a particular colour, and he said: because it was the cheapest. The industrial designer therefore thinks of the aesthetic side of the job as simply a matter of providing a finish, and although this may be most scrupulously done he avoids aesthetic problems that are bound up with contemporary culture because such things are not considered useful. An engineer must never be caught writing poetry.</p>

                 <div class="sticky-chapter5"> <h2 class="sticky-textL"> What is a designer? </h2></div>
                 <section class="content"> 
                 <p> The designer works differently. <span class="highlight">  He gives the right weight to each part of the project in hand, and he knows that the ultimate form of the object is psychologically vital when the potential buyer is making up his mind. </span>He therefore tries to give it a form as appropriate as possible to its function, a form that one might say arises spontaneously from the function, from the mechanical part (whenthere is one), from the most appropriate material, from the most up-to-date production tech-niques, from a calculation of costs, and from other psychological and aesthetic factors.</p>
                <p>  In the early days of rationalism it used to be said that an object was beautiful in so far as it was functional, and only the most practical functions were taken into account.
                     Various kinds of tool were used as evidence for this argu-ment, such as surgical instruments. <span class="highlight"> Today we do not think in terms of beauty but of formal coherence, and even the
                    'decorative function of the object is thought of as a psychological element. </span> For beauty in the abstract may be defined as what is called style, with the consequent need to force everything into a given style because it is new. Thus in the recent past we have had the aerodynamic style, which has been applied not only to aeroplanes and cars but to electric irons, perambulators and armchairs. On one occasion I even saw an aerodynamic hearse, which is about as far as the aerodynamic style can go (speeding the departing guest?).</p>
                 </section>
                    <div class="sticky-chapter6"> <h2 class="sticky-textL"> Beauty in Design </h2></div>
                    <section class="content"> 
                    <p> We have therefore discarded beauty in the abstract sense, as something stuck on to the technical part of a thing, like a stylish car body or a decoration tastefully chosen from the work of some great artist. <span class="highlight"> Instead we have formal coherence, rather as we see it in nature. </span> A leaf has the form it has because it belongs to a certain tree and fulfils a certain function; its structure is determined by the veins which carry the sap, and the skeleton that supports it might have been worked out by mathematics. Even so, there are many kinds of leaf, and the leaves of any single tree differ slightly among themselves. But if we saw a fig leaf on a weeping-willow we would have the feeling that all was not well. It would lack coherence.</p>
                <p> A leaf is beautiful not because it is stylish but because it is natural, created in its exact form by its exact function. A designer tries to make an object as naturally as a tree puts forth a leaf. <span class="highlight"> He does not smother his object with his own personal taste but tries to be objec-tive. </span> He helps the object, if I may so put it, to make itself by its own proper means, so that a ventilator comes to have just the shape of a ventilator, a fiasco for wine has the shape that blown glass gives it, as a cat is inevitably covered with cat-fur. Each object takes on its own form. But of course this will not be fixed and final because techniques change, new materials are discovered, and with every innovation the problem arises again and the form of the object may change.</p>
                <p> At one time people thought in terms of fine art and commercial art, pure art and applied art. So we used to have sew-ing-machines built by engineers and then decorated by an artist in gold and mother-of-pearl. Now we no longer have this distinction between fine and not-fine, pure and applied.
                <p> <span class="highlight"> The definition of art that has caused so much confusion in recent times, and allowed so many fast ones to be pulled, is now losing its prestige.  </span> Art is once more becoming a trade, as it was in ancient times when the artist was summoned by 'society to make certain works of visual communication (called frescoes) to inform the public of a certain religious event.</p>
